# CS-330

When designing software, I start by defining clear requirements and breaking them down into manageable components. I use UML diagrams, pseudocode, and design patterns to 
structure the system effectively. My work on this project has strengthened my ability to integrate multiple technologies, optimize UI/UX for interactive dashboards, and improve 
data visualization techniques.

For this project, I followed an iterative design processâ€”starting with requirements gathering, followed by prototyping, testing, and refining the design based on feedback. The 
structured approach ensured efficiency and adaptability. These tactics, such as modular development and user centered design, can be applied to future projects to enhance 
scalability and maintainability.

When developing programs, I focus on writing modular and scalable code. While working on my 3D scene, I used new strategies like lighting optimization, texture 
mapping, and efficient OpenGL rendering techniques. Iteration was crucial in refining object positioning, adjusting shaders, and improving performance. My approach to coding has 
evolved to emphasize reusable components, better debugging strategies, and performance optimization.

Computer science plays a critical role in achieving my goals by providing problem-solving skills and technical expertise applicable across industries. Computational graphics and 
visualizations have given me deeper insights into rendering techniques, UI/UX design, and real-time data representation, which will benefit my future studies. Professionally, 
these skills enhance my ability to develop interactive applications, simulations, and data-driven solutions, making me a more versatile software
